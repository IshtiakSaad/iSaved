# 🍏 iSaved!

Imagine you're shopping for a MacBook Pro with specific specs—say, an M4 chip, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage. You see it priced at $1,799 on Apple's site. But what if I told you that exactly the same core hardware is available in a Mac Mini for just $799—a $1,000 savings if you already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse?

This isn't a glitch. It's Apple's business model. They use the same silicon and components across their product lineup (MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, iMac, Mac Studio), but price them dramatically differently based on form factor and peripherals included. Laptops command a premium for portability and built-in displays. Desktops offer the same power for less. All-in-ones like iMac bundle screens at a markup.

The catch? Consumers rarely notice. Apple's configurator is siloed—each product lives in isolation. You can't easily ask: "Show me all Apple devices with my exact specs and their prices." Resellers and price trackers focus on deals, not cross-product equivalence. This creates a hidden arbitrage opportunity that savvy buyers miss, while Apple quietly extracts maximum margin.

Well that's over! Now you don’t have to scroll through endless pages—just pick your **Processor**, **RAM**, and **Storage**, hit **Match**, and let the 🍎 magic happen!
